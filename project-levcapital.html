              </div>
              <h2>The Goal</h2>
              <p>Let me give you the lowdown on Lev Marketplace!</p>
              <p>Our main aim with Lev Marketplace is to connect commercial real estate investors with the perfect lenders for their needs. Our ultimate goal? Ensuring that our clients not only secure more deals but also close them faster and with better terms compared to their competitors.</p>
              <p>How do we achieve this? By empowering our clients to analyze lenders based on various deal features, seamlessly request quotes, and confidently identify the strengths and weaknesses of each offer. With Lev Marketplace, closing a competitive deal is no longer a shot in the dark—it's a sure thing! 🏢💼</p>
              <p>Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty details of our project!</p>

              <h2>📙 Documentation Management</h2>
              <p>Our primary focus was to ensure seamless and transparent communication between brokers and borrowers within the platform. They collaborate on a range of tasks, including document requests and information sharing from the borrower.</p>
              <p>We took special care to customize document visibility, recognizing the sensitivity of financial information. With this in mind, brokers, borrowers, and lenders each have their dedicated document tab on the task dashboard. This setup allows for easy access to all shared documents, complete with a specialized search engine to quickly find what they need—all while keeping within the context of the task at hand. 📄🔍</p>

              <h3>Deals task dashboard</h3>
              <p>Let's zoom in on another key aspect of our project:</p>
              <p>Both brokers and borrowers will have clear visibility into their own pending tasks, as well as those of others. We've made sure to highlight any blocking tasks that may require immediate attention, ensuring smooth progress.</p>
              <p>Tasks are neatly organized by stage, providing users with a clear overview of their position in the process and what steps come next. This streamlined approach makes it effortless to track progress and stay on top of things every step of the way. 🚀📝</p>

              <h2>📝 Deal Feed</h2>
              <p>In order to keep borrowers informed and on track with their deal, we introduced a dynamic feed where they can stay updated with the latest developments on their deals. This feed provides real-time insights into the status of their transactions, ensuring borrowers are always in the loop and on schedule. 📰🔄</p>
              <p>To structure feed notifications, I researched and listed all types of notifications we could send to borrowers. These include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Notifications about lenders involved in their deal: for example, when a lender is added, contacted by brokers, or when they pass or review the deal.</li>
                <li>Notifications about terms: informing borrowers of new terms received (since one lender can send multiple terms).</li>
                <li>Notifications about task statuses: including notifications for new tasks, updates to tasks, and task assignments.</li>
                <li>Notifications about task notes: particularly important as comments are made to unblock tasks.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Also, some things that I needed to consider to design notifications:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Notifications may include actions, and in this case, we aim to ensure these actions are very clear for the user.</li>
                <li>Lenders can send more than one term for a deal</li>
                <li>Updates in lenders and terms can be done with a note</li>
                <li>If a lender passed there is a reason attached</li>
                <li>User may have multiple deals and, in that case, they would be following multiple deals notifications.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Feed Cards Topology</h2>
              <p>I meticulously crafted the structure of our feed cards to be both versatile and intuitive, accommodating various types of content seamlessly. Each card is designed with distinct colors and icons, ensuring easy recognition—users can quickly spot new terms or updates at a glance.</p>

              <h2>📊🔍 Lender's analysis Tool</h2>
              <p>Identifying the perfect lender for our borrowers hinges on our thorough lender analysis. We needed to deliver an analysis tool to provide invaluable insights into how lenders operate their business and the types of deals they prefer.</p>
              <p>By understanding these preferences, brokers can effectively match lenders with the most suitable deals, ensuring successful partnerships for all parties involved.</p>
