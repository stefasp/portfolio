                <h1><span class="highlight">Fennel:</span> Invest in what you believe</h1>
                <p>NYC 2023</p>
            </div>
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>I worked with Fennel as a freelancer during the initial phase of their app, which was already live on the Apple Store but only accessible to a limited group of users. They approached me to enhance the app by identifying usability issues, assessing their severity, and understanding the underlying reasons behind these challenges. Our ultimate goal was to find and develop solutions that would allow us to iterate the product and improve the overall user experience.</p>
            
            <h2>Timeline & Process</h2>
            <p>To redesign the workflow and features, we followed the following approach:</p>
            <div class="img-half"><img src="img/projects/fennel/00.png"/></div> <br/>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>UX Evaluation:</strong> Conducted a thorough evaluation of the current user experience to identify potential issues. This was followed by team debates where we discussed principal doubts and product issues that needed to be addressed.</li>
              <li><strong>User Testing Planning:</strong> I created a detailed testing script based on identified goals and defined user tasks accordingly. I actively involved team members by inviting them to provide ideas and participate in planning meetings, ensuring a comprehensive approach.</li>
              <li><strong>User Interviews:</strong> Performed user interviews, starting with open conversations to build rapport and gain insights. This was followed by guiding users through specific tasks to detect usability issues and gather valuable feedback.</li>
              <li><strong>Findings Report:</strong> Prepared and presented a comprehensive report, classifying findings into Critical (blocking tasks or eroding trust), Relevant ( improvement opportunities without jeopardizing trust or usability), and Non-Blocker (minor usability concerns or subjective opinions not backed by behavior).</li>
              <li><strong>Prioritization & Roadmap:</strong> Cross-referenced the user insights with existing metrics and the product roadmap to prioritize multiple projects. This ensured that the most impactful changes were addressed first.</li>
              <li><strong>Ideation & Brainstorming:</strong> Led ideation and brainstorming sessions with the team to generate potential solutions. This included sketching, wireframing, and collaborative discussions. For example, after a brainstorming session, we generated several proposals aimed at visualizing product value in empty states. These were later reviewed with the development team to ensure feasibility.
                <img src="img/projects/fennel/02-2.png"/>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Final Design:</strong>Consolidated the best ideas into final designs and designed prototypes for user testing.. After gathering feedback, I refined the designs and prepared them for launch.</li>
              <li><strong>Components & UX Documentation:</strong> Aligning with other designers and create or modifing the Design System components. Creating UX documentation explaining component statues and behaviors.</li>
              <li><strong>Handoff & Impact Evaluation:</strong> Completed the handoff to the development team with clear documentation and design specifications. Post-launch, I conducted an impact evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the implemented changes and identify any further areas for improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Script & User Testing</h2>
            <p>I began by assessing the app's current state, identifying potential usability issues, unmet user needs, and gathering insights from the team on workflows and features they wanted to prioritize.</p>
            <p>Using this information, I developed a script for user interviews and testing. I always start with open-ended questions to understand how users feel about the app and their experiences so far. This approach helps uncover improvement opportunities and unmet needs that may not surface during structured app testing. I also tailor the tasks during the test to address users' specific needs.</p>
            <p>After conducting the tests, I compiled a comprehensive UX report that included a prioritization of issues based on their severity and a set of actionable recommendations. I also identified a variety of user personas, opening up the conversation to debate on targeting the product to a specific set of users. Following the team's review, we embarked on several projects to refine various aspects of the user experience.</p>


            <h2>Onboarding</h2>
            <p>User activation is crucial for growth, and the onboarding experience plays a significant role in this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ðŸ’¯ Onboarding touches every user.</li>
              <li>ðŸ¥‡ First impressions are lasting impressions.</li>
              <li>ðŸŽ¯ It's the most powerful driver of retention, and retention is the cornerstone of growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When I joined Fennel, only a paid version of the app was available.. Since the current users were team-invited, we wanted to understand any issues they encountered during onboarding and their overall experience. Here are some of the key pain points identified during user interviews:</p>
            
            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>Early Trust Barrier: </strong>The onboarding process required sensitive financial information right at the beginning. Users, unfamiliar with the product, felt uneasy sharing such data without knowing more about the app. <img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Free Trial Option.</strong> To lower this barrier, I recommended offering a trial experience where users could explore the app and discover it's value before needing to share personal and financial information. <img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>
            <img src="img/projects/fennel/01.png"/>

            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>No-visible Value Proposition for new users: </strong>The user portfolio page, a crucial feature for investors, appeared empty for both trial and paid users who hadnâ€™t made any purchases yet. Other pages such as votes, create an account, watchlists, where empty and didnâ€™t explain how users could get value out of them. <img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Implement data-samples and improve empty states.</strong> By integrating sample data, users could better understand the value they would gain from the product, even in sections that would normally appear empty. We also redesigned the pages where sample data could not be added to show cards explaining the most relevant features of the page. By adding coach-marks we could highlight and explain valuable but less discoverable features, especially those highly utilized by heavy users. This helped new users learn about and navigate these features more effectively. <img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>
            <img src="img/projects/fennel/02.png"/>

            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>Subscription Concerns: </strong>The subscription method raised doubts and mistrust, particularly because it was outside the App Store/Google Play. Users felt a lack of control, as one mentioned concerns about signing up directly through the app and paying via bank transfer, which lacked the confidence and control provided by in-store subscriptions.<img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Share reasons and improve accessibility. </strong>By informing users why Fennel requests a subscription method outside the Store (due to financial compliance), they are less likely to feel tricked and may feel more confident in continuing the process. Additionally, bringing subscription management closer to them will help users feel more in control.<img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>

            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>Lengthy and Time-Consuming Process: </strong>Users felt that the subscription flow (where personal information was requested) was too long and required too much effort. One user mentioned that, if they not known the Fennel team personally, they might not have completed the process due to the time and personal information required.<img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Support Web Access and Save Progress.</strong> Unfortunately, shortening the form was not possible due to compliance requirements. However, the user experience can be improved by allowing users to save their progress and continue the process later, even on the web.<img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>
            <!-- <p>These improvements not only addressed user pain points but also laid a stronger foundation for onboarding as Fennel opened its doors to a wider audience.</p> -->

            <h2>Value Proposition Findings</h2>
            <p>Fennel's value proposition is its ability to evaluate the ethical aspects of companies, enabling investors to make conscious investment decisions. This is supported by providing metrics across various aspects. This feedback was deemed both highly relevant and critical.</p>
            
            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>Confusing Data Presentation:</strong> Users found the data Fennel provided about companies confusing and, at times, incorrect because it wasnâ€™t transparent how the numbers were derived. Some even conclude that the data might be buggy, lowering their confidence in the product.<img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Explain How Data is collected and managed.</strong> We implemented explanations within the app to clarify how company data was collected and analyzed. This included visual aids that showed how different data categories were weighted to calculate the final values. These explanations helped users better understand and trust the information Fennel provided.<img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>
            <img src="img/projects/fennel/03.png"/>

            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>Confusing Data Presentation:</strong> Users found the data Fennel provided about companies confusing and, at times, incorrect because it wasnâ€™t transparent how the numbers were derived. Some even conclude that the data might be buggy, lowering their confidence in the product.<img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Intuitive color use, references and tags.</strong> To use colors effectively, the starting point will be set at the yellow area of the line gradient. Everything below that line will appear as orange, and everything above it as green, allowing users to quickly detect areas of change. The date range will be clarified, with the start and end dates specified above the graph. When tapped, the date and value of the selected area will be displayed.<img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>
            <img src="img/projects/fennel/04.png"/>

            <div class="work-two-columns">
              <div class="problem"><strong>Search & Compare: </strong>Filters and table customization were hard to discover without guidance. Users also found it frustrating to compare companies, requiring multiple profile visits to compare companies.<img src="img/error.png"/></div>
              <div class="solution"><strong>Proposal: Intuitive color use, references and tags.</strong> A sticky bar with quick-access to filters was added, allowing users to apply common filters easily or access the full filter page for more options. To solve this, I designed a collapsible results view with a shortcut to expand or collapse all items, prioritizing basic information with more details available on expansion.<img src="img/fix.png"/></div>
            </div>
            <img src="img/projects/fennel/05.png"/>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>We strategically rolled out improvements to ensure their impact could be effectively measured. To avoid metric overlap, we first launched the onboarding enhancements, followed by the sample data and the company metric explanations.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Onboarding completion rate</strong> increased by 13% after introducing the free trial option and progress-saving features.</li>
              <li><strong>Retention rate</strong> improved by 8% in the first 30 days post-onboarding enhancements.</li>
              <li><strong>Sample data interaction</strong> 71% of new users interacted with sample data, leading to a 25% boost in user engagement during the free trial period.</li>
              <li><strong>Conversion rate</strong> from trial to paid subscription increased by 12% after clarifying how data was collected and analyzed, and refining the subscription process.</li>
            </ul>
