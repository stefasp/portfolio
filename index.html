                <p>NYC 2020</p>
            </div>
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>The biggest challenge in this project was to find a flexible flow that would consistently support all the existing picking flows within a warehouse, in addition to solving multiple needs, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the scanner is more reliable and effective but, at the same time, exceptions are needed. The scan must be the user's primary path, but administrators must be able to set special permissions.</li>
                <li>Avoid blocking the entire flow due to an order that cannot be completed. If an order needs to be left aside, do not delay other orders.</li>
                <li>Avoid blocking the user process due to errors such as empty locations or missing or broken elements.Improve learning curve and efficiency. Users need to use various flows and learn how to use them quickly.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/01.png">

            <h2>Item's Cards States & Behavior:</h2>
            <p>The item cards were tailored to accommodate various flows and provide the necessary information at each stage of the process. In the following image, you can see the different states of the card as the user progresses through the flow:</p>
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/02.png">
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/03.png">

            <h2>Picking Page Topology:</h2>
            <p>The picking page includes a card that guides users through their next steps, whether it's selecting a specific number of items or assigning a tote (containers used to organize orders).</p>
            <p>At the top, users will find details about the item to be picked, including its location and the expected quantity.</p>
            <p>Additionally, users will find other available actions, such as reporting errors if needed. Each action also offers a manual option for situations where a functional scanner is unavailable.</p>
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/04.png">

            <h2>Picking Page Card States</h2>
            <p>This is how the state of the card changes through the flow:</p>
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/05.png">

            <h2>Picking Page Examples</h2>
            <p>These are a few examples of possible states of the page and card</p>
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/06.png">
            <img src="img/projects/shiphero/07.png">

            <h2>Some other pages</h2>
            <p>The initial image depicts the error reporting page, where users encounter a preview of the item along with a list of error types. After selecting the error type, users are prompted to complete a form with necessary information for submission to the manager. Additionally, the system implements adjustments to prevent future errors, such as temporarily reducing the item quantity to prevent wasted time for other workers.</p>
            <p>The second image illustrates situations where totes need to be set aside due to errors, such as lack of stock of an item preventing order completion.</p>
            <p>In the third image, a modal window is displayed for manual tote assignment, along with a page where users can view all pending orders for picking and have the option to delete individual ones.</p>

            <p>Forta is a network and a community of leading security experts contributing to detect scams and threats.</p>
            <p>They continuously enhance their detection capabilities with machine learning, ensuring heightened efficiency and agility. Incentivizing community participation, they offer rewards to maintain code quality at its zenith. The integrity of their internal economy is upheld through the utilization of the FORT token.</p>
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>Forta had no subscription plans and users could subscribe to any bot and integrate unlimitedly with their own bots. The idea was to offer different plans and prices depending on the user's needs and the use of the software.</p>
            <p>To support this, we needed to offer 3 different plans: General Data, Special Data and Bot Execution.</p>
            <p>The bot execution plan was intended for developers and this plan will also have the option to choose how many units they will need to use.</p>
            <p>The special data plan will have two types of feeds and the user should be able to choose one or both.</p>
            <p>Users can choose as many plans as they need and upgrade at any time.</p>

            <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
            <p>The first step was to brainstorm different layouts and also evaluate the ideal flow.</p>

            <p>Although it was recommended from a usability point of view that users can purchase several plans at the same time, due to technical difficulties the first version will only support purchasing one plan at a time, and future iterations will be planned to include the purchase of multiple plans.</p>

            <h2>User profile</h2>
            <p>User’s profile could be empty (with no plan or history) or filled with data.</p>
            <p>When viewing a bot execution plan, they should see how many units they have available and how many they already have in use.</p>
            <p>In addition, feedback on the status of the plan was included with alerts to avoid problems such as the automatic cancellation of a plan due to lack of payment (when the user would have wanted to prevent it).</p>

            <h2>User Flow</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>User could access payment directly from the plan preview in their profile.</li>
              <li>User would access payment after plan selection</li>
              <li>If clicking “Buy new plan” the plans already ongoing will not appear in the list</li>
              <li>If editing an existing plan a modal will open to change the plan settings</li>
              <li>Users could access a new API key modal</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>Let me give you the lowdown on Lev Marketplace!</p>
            <p>Our main aim with Lev Marketplace is to connect commercial real estate investors with the perfect lenders for their needs. Our ultimate goal? Ensuring that our clients not only secure more deals but also close them faster and with better terms compared to their competitors.</p>
            <p>How do we achieve this? By empowering our clients to analyze lenders based on various deal features, seamlessly request quotes, and confidently identify the strengths and weaknesses of each offer. With Lev Marketplace, closing a competitive deal is no longer a shot in the dark—it's a sure thing! 🏢💼</p>
            <p>Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty details of our project!</p>

            <h2>📙 Documentation Management</h2>
            <p>Our primary focus was to ensure seamless and transparent communication between brokers and borrowers within the platform. They collaborate on a range of tasks, including document requests and information sharing from the borrower.</p>
            <p>We took special care to customize document visibility, recognizing the sensitivity of financial information. With this in mind, brokers, borrowers, and lenders each have their dedicated document tab on the task dashboard. This setup allows for easy access to all shared documents, complete with a specialized search engine to quickly find what they need—all while keeping within the context of the task at hand. 📄🔍</p>

            <h2>Deals task dashboard</h2>
            <p>Let's zoom in on another key aspect of our project:</p>
            <p>Both brokers and borrowers will have clear visibility into their own pending tasks, as well as those of others. We've made sure to highlight any blocking tasks that may require immediate attention, ensuring smooth progress.</p>
            <p>Tasks are neatly organized by stage, providing users with a clear overview of their position in the process and what steps come next. This streamlined approach makes it effortless to track progress and stay on top of things every step of the way. 🚀📝</p>
            <img src="img/projects/lev/03.png">

            <h2>📝 Deal Feed</h2>
            <p>In order to keep borrowers informed and on track with their transactions, we introduced a dynamic feed where they can stay updated with the latest developments on their deals. This feed provides real-time insights into the status of their transactions, ensuring borrowers are always in the loop and on schedule. 📰🔄</p>
            <img src="img/projects/lev/04.png">

            <h2>Feed Cards Topology</h2>
            <p>We meticulously crafted the structure of our feed cards to be both versatile and intuitive, accommodating various types of content seamlessly. Each card is designed with distinct colors and icons, ensuring easy recognition—users can quickly spot new terms or updates at a glance.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we've tailored the content of each card to meet specific needs. Some cards are actionable, prompting users to take immediate steps, while others provide essential information without requiring further action. This thoughtful approach enhances user engagement and efficiency within the platform. 🃏🎨📋</p>

            <h2>📊🔍 Lender's analysis Tool</h2>
            <p>Identifying the perfect lender for our borrowers hinges on our thorough lender analysis. This analysis provides invaluable insights into how lenders operate their business and the types of deals they prefer.</p>
            <p>By understanding these preferences, we can effectively match lenders with the most suitable deals, ensuring successful partnerships for all parties involved.</p>

                <p>NYC 2023</p>
            </div>
            <h2>How did we started?</h2>
            <p>I worked with Fennel as a freelancer, and they already had a working app in the Apple Store when they reached me to improve their app.</p>
            <p>I started interviewing their users and tested their app. The open conversation provided me with general information and feedback, allowing me to detect which moments users remembered as most frustrating and context about when they used the app and why.</p>
            <p>Then, the team had specific flows that they feared were the weakest or most relevant at a business level, we focused on testing these with specific tasks.</p>
            <p>This allowed me to get to know different types of users and what type of use they gave or expected to give to the app, how it failed them, and how it helped them as investors.</p>
            <p>With the results, I wrote a UX report, including priority criteria according to how blocking the issue was and a chapter with recommendations. After the team's review, several projects followed, in which we modified different parts of the experience.</p>
            <img src="img/projects/fennel/01.png">

            <h2>Onboarding</h2>
            <p>Although the onboarding process was not tested, some users shared some of their experiences while in this process:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The onboarding process requests very sensitive financial information from the user in a very early stage. They don't know much about the product and they don't trust the app yet either. The barrier is very high in the very initial stage. I recommend offering the trial experience without this information, then if the user wants to buy a share or wants to subscribe we should request it.</li>
              <li>A user comments that if it wasn't that he knew the Fennel team, he would not have spent the time required to go through the onboarding and would not have chosen to expose such personal information.</li>
              <li>Observing bugs and errors during this onboarding process discourages them from continuing since they would expect the app to have more bugs and errors.</li>
              <li>The subscription method generates doubts and mistrust. The fact that the subscription form is outside the App Store / Google Play can create distrust and make them feel out of control. A user told me that in the onboarding the subscription is signed and this is paid with transfers directly to his bank account. The confidence and control that a user gains when subscribing through the store are missing in this way.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To improve the onboarding experience the following changes were made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The user could create an account to try the app for free, avoiding having to share financial information and compromise too soon.</li>
              <li>In the free trial, the user could see how the app would look like with data, or design the UI to be more clear about the sections even if they are empty, so they can understand the value and the features Fennel will provide them with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some portfolio fixes were made: some information was clarified, such as how volatile the portfolio was, how it changed compared to a past period, and how the data updates worked.</li>
              <li>Increasing visibility and learnability of valuable features with coachmarks. Some features were more difficult to discover and some even needed some explanation due to how technical they were. We learned which of these features were highly used by heavy users so, we concluded it was worth including these quick tips for new users.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Search Experience</h2>
                <p>Several issues were discovered, some of them were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Without my direct indication (in the user testing) users couldn't discover the filters and table-customization page. For this, a sticky bar with the filters was created, if the user wanted to add multiple filters (or apply less relevant filters) they could access the filter page or, if wanting to apply one of the most used filters, they could access them through the shortcut in the sticky bar.</li>
                  <li>When seeing results, users found annoying and time-consuming that it wasn't possible to see more information about the companies from the listing view. They needed to visit each company profile. To compare companies the user has to go in and out of the profiles and try to remember the information they see. For this issue, I designed a results view where items could be expanded or collapsed while adding also a shortcut to open and close all results at once. The most basic information was prioritized, while secondary information could be seen when seeing the expanded view.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Company Profile</h2>
            <p>I found several issues to address, some of them were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is too much information in the profiles and it was difficult for them to get to any conclusion. Knowing what kind of information about the company was available took a lot of effort, they needed to scroll through the entire profile. For these, a menu was added and each section of the profile was approached separately to simplify readability.</li>
              <li>ESG Wheel: The information in the tooltip that opens when you click on the functions does not provide much information. What other details can be said about that feature? </li>
              <li>It was very difficult to know if a score is positive or negative. That number is not clear and absolutely all users had to read the tooltip to understand that it is relative to the industry. The information on the card also does not help them understand how good or bad the company is rated and why is it different from others. For these, the comparison with the benchmark or the industry was clarified plus the answer of the category (for example, Carbon emissions are low, and that is uncommon in the industry)</li>
              <li>To learn about the existing categories they have to click on each circle and read the name. The user cannot easily have a global idea of the categories and their score. Having to click on all of them implies a lot of effort. For these the cards were redesigned, they had a collapsed view with a summary of the answer and how they are compared to the industry, and then they could see more details when opened.</li>
              <li>The type of graph does not allow to quickly visualize the most relevant factors for the user and to visualize in which it stands out, it does not facilitate the comparison. To fix this issue I used color to refer to the category of the topic, for example, all environmental topics are green.</li>
              <li>The information provided had different formats depending on the card, which was very confusing, and took too much effort to understand what the result meant. All cards were changed to have the same format and keep consistency.</li>
              <li>It would be interesting to incorporate the date on which the company announces earnings since some users use this date as a reference to buy shares.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Porfolio's graph redesign</h2>
                <p>The performance graphic was redesigned to fix the following issues:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The color used in the graph is green or red depending on whether the last value went down or up compared to the starting point.</li>
                  <li>There is no time reference, what is the starting date? what is the finish date?</li>
                  <li>There is no data on when the last update was, once the portfolio is loaded the data is not updated again until the next load or refresh. On the other hand, if the market is closed, the data is from the last information received when it was active.</li>
                  <li>The control to change the period looks a little lost and goes unnoticed, even appearing to be part of the graph.</li>
                  <li>By clicking on the graph you see the only comparative reference, which is a line.</li>
                </ul>
